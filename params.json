  "body": "## Approach\r\nI have learned from reading Cracking The Coding Interview, Interview Cake and Project Euler that problems can be approached in similar ways. I have noticed that Greedy and Brute Force Algorithms are very helpful in breaking down a problem. Most of the time, there are keywords in the problems that help determine which algorithm to use. For example when you want to find the highest value in an array, use the greedy approach to keep track of the highest value as of yet. \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n## Review\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n",
